            <p>I am currently an art student who aspires to become a cartoon animator and a comic illustrator. I want to be
                able to influence people's day for the better. Many cartoons like Steven Universe by Rebecca Sugar, have
                helped me feel better when I have had a rough week. Some people underestimate the power of a heartwarming
                story. Human race has been able to communicate through art since the beginning of time, and I want to use my
                skills to contribute to making the world a calmer place</p>

            <p> When my family moved to the United States, our lives took a complete turn, and I belive that we had to go
                through everything, so I could be where I am today. </p>
